Project Goals: The team aimed to determine if current CCUS projects are sufficient to meet future carbon reduction targets, particularly the Paris Agreement goals for 2050.

Data Analysis:

Over 10,000 data rows were analyzed from 4 datasets related to CO2 emissions and CCUS projects, with feature engineering and time-series models (e.g., SARIMA) used to predict emissions.
Significant correlations were found between CO2 emissions, GDP, and population growth.
Model Performance:

The SARIMA model predicted future CO2 emissions with low error rates and a projection through 2050, showing a general decline but still exceeding the levels required to meet the Paris Agreement targets.
CO2 Emissions Gap:

A gap of 2250 million tons of CO2 per year was identified between the projected emissions and the levels needed to meet the Paris Agreement targets by 2050.
CCUS Projects:

Although there is a significant increase in North American CCUS projects since 2020, the current capacity is not enough. An estimated 860 additional CCUS projects would be required to close the emissions gap.
Conclusions:

The presentation emphasizes the urgent need to scale up CCUS projects and improve technologies to meet climate goals. Without aggressive action, achieving the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C global warming limit will remain out of reach.
